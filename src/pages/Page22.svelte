          <Description
            content="In July 2011, HERL relocated from its original research lab at the VAâ€™s Highland Drive facility to the newly renovated Bakery Square. This move represented a pivotal moment for HERL, offering its investigators, staff, and faculty the chance to establish a state-of-the-art facility tailored to their specific requirements. The transition brought about significant improvements, including the addition of a spacious laboratory bay and a dedicated machine shop area. HERL celebrated this milestone with an open house on August 4th, where they welcomed family, friends, and supporters from the VA and Pitt communities."
