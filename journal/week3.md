# Week 3

Current Deployment: https://herl-digital-narrative-diz388ni4-liambsullivas-projects.vercel.app

### New Features!

- Book is responsive for different screen widths (for mobile)
- Book is responsive for most screen heights (for displaying in iframe)
- Content responsively adjusts font size based on screen width and height

### Background

This week was a rough one for me personally. I was sick for the first half, and got put on medication to help out and stay productive. Because of this, I lost a good amount of time that I would have spent working. With that said, I got a lot done in the first couple weeks, so it naturally evens itself out.

### Responsiveness

The main focus of this week's feature set is responsiveness. Because this is going to be displayed in an iframe when it's deployed, it's essential that it renders well on smaller screens.

While it isn't perfect in all cases, the content stays consistently legible for screen widths down to 450px. Here it is in action:

It even works decently well with height too! 500px is the max height I expect users to need responsiveness for, so it breaks past that. Trying to get it to work past that height is nearly impossible without cutting out content.

That is all for the week, unfortunately. Hoping to finally get to some non lorem ipsum content in next week. The templating is all done, it just needs to be coded into action!
