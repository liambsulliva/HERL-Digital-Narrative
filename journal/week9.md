### New Features!

**Content Transitions Revamped**

- Content loading is delayed to keep the browser from being overwhelmed loading content.
- Content load has a nice fading transition to give it a polished look.

**New Image Loading System (via Svelte Store)**

- Images preload before a given page loads, making page transitions way more seamless.
- Images use a flashing grey placeholder if the server responds unusually slow.
