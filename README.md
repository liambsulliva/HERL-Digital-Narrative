# HERL Throughout the Years Digital Narrative

This is a digital narrative project that I am working on as part of the HERL Throughout the Years program. The goal of this project is to create an interactive digital narrative that explores HERL's 30+ years of history developing cutting-edge technology for disabled veterans.

## Technologies Used

- Svelte
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can install the dependencies for this project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your browser to the project.

# Deployment

This project is deployed on a webserver sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh. See the final product on the [HERL Website](https://herl.pitt.edu).
